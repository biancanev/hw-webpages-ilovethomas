		<p>ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. The higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can be seen in the photos above. When ks = 500 N/m, the spring is
			at its most elastic, which is why the cloth has the most folds and wrinkles as it falls and at its rest state
			out of all the runs. At ks = 5000 N/m, the cloth has only subtle folds as it falls
			and only loses the smaller folds that were in ks = 500 N/m's rest state. At
			ks = 50000 N/m, there are almost no folds at all when it is mid falling and only
			one fold at its rest state. The curvature at the top of the cloth is also much less
			compared to the previous runs.

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>Density plays a role in calculating the masspoints' acceleration.
			This is because According to Newton's laws, mass is given by
			<em>m = &rho; &middot; V</em> and acceleration by <em>F = m/a</em>,
			where &rho; is equal to density. This means that the greater the density,
			the greater the force, because acceleration is constant.
		</p>
		<p>This can be observed in the images above. When density = 1 g/cm^2, the cloth is basically
			smooth with no wrinkles when it is falling and at its rest state. The top of the cloth
			is almost horizontal. As density
			increases, and thus force, more wrinkles and folds are created. The top of the cloth
			resembles more of a parabola now. At density = 15 g/cm^2,
			the cloth has mild folds at both the mid fall and rest state. When density = 50 g/cm^2,
			the cloth has the most pronounced folds and the greatest curvature at the top
			middle of the cloth.

		</div>
		<p>Damping is the process where energy is lost in the environment.
			If damping, or d=0%, this means that no energy is lost. If d is greater
			than 0, this means that energy is lost. The rate energy is lost
			increases as d increases.
		</p>
		<p>This loss of energy can be observed with the various runs of the pinned
			cloth. When d is equal to 0%, the mass points, dont lose energy, which is why
			as it is falling, there is much more vibrations and wrinkles,
			indicating more energy. It also falls very fast, almost instantly, and continues to
			oscillate, never coming to rest. As d goes up, the amoount of wrinkles decreases. When
			d = 0.2%, the cloth has fewer sharp wrinkles compared to when d = 0%, and the final rest
			state has softer folds. The extreme is when d = 1%. As it is falling, it appears to
			be almost completely smooth and when it is at rest, it lacks the subtle folds
			that d = 0.2% had. It falls much slower and comes to rest without any extra swinging.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<h3>Implementation of collisions of planes and spheres</h3>
		<h4>
			Spheres
		</h4>
		<p>
			For sphere collision handling, our implementation is as follows.
			First we calculate the vector difference between the point mass position
			and the sphere's origin, or center. If this difference's magnitude
			is greater than the sphere's radius, there's no collision, and the
			function returns immediately. If the difference's magnitude is less than
			or equal to the sphere's radius, a collision is detected, and the code continues on.
			We then calculate a unit direction vector from
			the sphere's origin to the point mass.
			This unit vector is used to find the tangent point on the sphere's surface by
			extending from the origin along the direction vector by the sphere's radius.
			The correction vector is then calculated as the
			difference between this tangent point and the point mass's previous position.
			Finally, the point mass's position is
			updated by adding this correction vector to its previous position, scaled by 1 - friction.
		</p>
		<h4>Planes</h4>
		<p>
			For plane collision handling, we first determine if a collision has occured by calculating 
			the signed distances from both the current and previous point mass positions to the plane. 
			This is done using a dot product with the normal vector of the plane and subtracting position 
			with the point on the plane.
	</p>
	
	\[Vector3D\ curDiff = pm.position - this->point\]
	\[Vector3D\ prevDiff = pm.last\_position - this->point\]
	\[double\ curPosDist = dot(this\rightarrow normal, curDiff)\]
	\[double\ prevPosDist = dot(this\rightarrow normal, prevDiff)\]
	
	<p>
			If both distances have the same sign, this means both positions are on the same side of the plane, 
			and there is no collision. If a collision is detected, we then compute the fraction t which is where the mass point intersects the plane. This is done with 
	</p>
	
	\[t = -prevPosDist / (curPosDist - prevPosDist)\]
	
	<p>
			where prevPosDist and curPosDist are the signed distances from above. 
			The intersection point is then found by the plane using linear interpolation with t where 
	</p>
	
	\[tangentPoint = pm.last\_position + t * (pm.position - pm.last\_position)\]
	
	<p>
			The correction vector is now calculated as the difference between this tangent point and the previous position, with a 
			small additional offset in the appropriate normal direction to prevent clipping with the plane.  
			Finally, the point mass's position is updated by adding the scaled correction vector to its previous 
			position, where the scaling factor accounts for friction.

			<figcaption>Final resting state with ks = 50000 N/m</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>As mentioned previously, ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. So the higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.</p>
		<p>With a low ks, ks = 500 N/m, the cloth is at its most elastic. The final
			resting state reflects this by having all of the cloth droop down almost
			vertically. There are also many vertical folds. When ks = 5000 N/m, the
			cloth becomes more stiff and there are less vertical folds now. The folds
			also beome less vertical, and start spreading out to the sides more. Finally,
			when ks = 50000 N/m, there are only a few vertical folds now. The folds are much
			bigger, and spread out even more to the sides, resisting gravity.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>Self Collisions Implementation</h3>
    <p>
			For self-collision handling, our implementation uses spatial hashing. First, we build a spatial map 
			by hashing the 3D positions of all point masses into a hash table. The hash function divides the 3D 
			space into boxes with dimensions \(w \times h \times t\) where:
	</p>
	
	\[w = 3 \cdot \text{width} / \text{num_width_points}\]
	\[h = 3 \cdot \text{height} / \text{num_height_points}\]
	\[t = \max(w, h)\]
	
	<p>
			To convert the point's 3D position into one of the boxes, we divide each coordinate by the 
			corresponding box dimension and take the floor of the result:
	</p>
	
	\[\text{boxI} = \lfloor \text{pos.x} / w \rfloor\]
	\[\text{boxJ} = \lfloor \text{pos.y} / h \rfloor\]
	\[\text{boxK} = \lfloor \text{pos.z} / t \rfloor\]
	
	<p>
			This gives us the box coordinates (i, j, k) that identify which box the point belongs to. We then 
			hash these i, j, k coordinates into a single hash value:
	</p>
	
	\[\text{hash} = \text{boxI} + \text{boxJ} \cdot 73856093 + \text{boxK} \cdot 19349663\]
	
	<p>
			Each box in the hash table contains a vector of point masses that are in that box. When checking 
			for self-collisions for each point mass, we look up its corresponding hash box and iterate through 
			all other point masses in that bucket. For each pair, we calculate the distance between them.
	</p>
	
	<p>
			If the distance is less than twice the cloth thickness, we compute a correction vector to push the 
			point masses apart:
	</p>
	
	\[\text{correctionVector} += \text{direction} \cdot (2 \cdot \text{thickness} - \text{dist})\]
	
	<p>
			The final correction vector is applied to the point mass's position, scaled by the number of 
			simulation steps to avoid over-correction:
	</p>
	
	\[\text{correctionVector} = \text{correctionVector} / \text{simulation_steps}\]
	\[\text{pm.position} = \text{pm.position} + \text{correctionVector}\]

		</div>
		<p>Once again, ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. So the higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.</p>
		<p>What this means is that, as ks increases, the more resistant to folds the
			cloth becomes. When ks = 2500 N/m, The cloth folds against itself easily and
			has the most folds. When ks = 5000 N/m, the cloth becomes slightly stiffer and
			the folds become less chaotic. The folds are more
			straight as compared to ks = 2500 N/m where the folds were kind of wavy. When ks
			= 50000 N/m, the cloth is very stiff. The folds are even straighter now and there
			are only a couple of big folds.
		</p>
		<h4>Density</h4>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

			<td style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="Images/Part 4/dens-30-mid.png" width="400px" />
				<figcaption>Mid fall with density = 30 g/cm^2</figcaption>
		</div>
		<p>As mentioned previously, density plays a role in calculating the masspoints' acceleration.
			This is because According to Newton's laws, mass is given by
			<em>m = &rho; &middot; V</em> and acceleration by <em>F = m/a</em>,
			where &rho; is equal to density. This means that the greater the density,
			the greater the force, because acceleration is constant.
		</p>
		<p>Density's impact on the cloth's self collisions is the opposite of the spring constant's impact.
			As density increases, there are more folds and wrinkles in the cloth. The cloth is calmest when
			density is set at 1 g/cm^2. The folds are few and large, and there are barely any
			wrinkles. When density = 15 g/cm^2, the folds become more and smaller, with wrinkles
			starting to appear. When density is equal to 30 g/cm^2, it has the most folds. The folds
			are no longer smooth and relatively horizontal. They also have wrinkles in them.
		</p>
		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h4>What are vertex and fragment shaders</h4>
		Vertex shaders, as the name suggests, are used to control the vertices of a model. This is very useful for
		simulating physics and how a model interacts with the physical environment and itself. A fragment shader, on the
		other hand, controls how the model is rendered. This allows us to control how a model looks (e.g. specular
		illumination, ambient lighting, etc.). By combining both vertex and fragment shading, we are able to fully control
		how a model looks. We can use vertex shading to control the physical geometry of the model and then enhance it with
		lighting effects from the fragment shader.
		<br>
		<h4>Blinn-Phong Shading</h4>
		Blinn-Phong shading is a shading method to provide specular reflection and ambient lighting to a model. The shading
		formula is as follows:
		\[\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_a+\mathbf{L}_d+\mathbf{L}_s\]
		where
		\[\mathbf{L}_a = k_a\mathbf{I}_a\]
		\[\mathbf{L}_d=k_d\frac{\mathbf{I}}{r^2}\max(0, \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{l})\]
		\[\mathbf{L}_s=k_s\frac{\mathbf{I}}{r^2}\max(0, \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{h})^p\]
		Given this formula, you can see that Blinn-Phong shading is just the superposition of diffuse shading with an
		ambient lighting term and a specular lighting term. You can see this effect in the images below:
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br>
		<h4>Texture, Bump and Displacement Mapping</h4>
		Once we have Blinn-Phong shading, we can build off this shader to implement texture mapping to add our own custom
		textures and even simulate coarseness with bump and displacement mapping. For texture mapping, we can get the map
		each pixel of the texture image to the pixels being rendered by the program using the <code>texture</code> function.
		You can see an example of texture mapping below:
		<br>
		<figure>
			<img src="Images/texture-2.png" alt="Cloth draped over sphere" style="width: 70%" />
			<figcaption>Texture shader</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<br>
		With this new texture mapping, we can use the map to add bumps and defects to our models using bump and displacement
		shading. Bump and displacement shading produce the same effects, but displacement actually edits the physical mesh
		while bump does not. Thus, when rendering, the texture appears more defined with displacement over bump shading. In
		both shaders, the textures appear more defined when passing in <code>-a 128 -0 128</code> for coarseness, but you
		can see that displacement is slightly more defined.

		<h4>Mirror Shading</h4>
		Another type of shader we built is the mirror shader. The mirror shader essentially takes incoming light from a map
		of the environment (light that is essentiall infintely far away), and computes the outgoing reflected light ray.
		This is the result:

		<h4>Extra Credit: Custom Shader</h4>
		For our custom shader, we decided to implement a time aspect to it. We added a time counter to the
		<code>clothSimulaotr</code> class and passed it to <code>Custom.frag</code> as a uniform. With this new unifrom, we
		can now vary the shader with time. To create a glowing effect, we used took the regular bump shader effect and
		superimposed a separate glowing diffuse effect on the edges to create the cool glowing effect. We controlled the
		glow diffuse value by multiplying it by a \(\sin(ft)\) term so that we got a smooth fading effect. We can see the
		end result in the gif below:
