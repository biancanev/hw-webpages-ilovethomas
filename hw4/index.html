		<p>ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. The higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can be seen in the photos above. When ks = 500 N/m, the spring is 
			at its most elastic, which is why the cloth has the most folds and wrinkles as it falls and at its rest state
			out of all the runs. At ks = 5000 N/m, the cloth has only subtle folds as it falls
			and only loses the smaller folds that were in ks = 500 N/m's rest state. At
			ks = 50000 N/m, there are almost no folds at all when it is mid falling and only
			one fold at its rest state. The curvature at the top of the cloth is also much less 
			compared to the previous runs. 
		</p>
		<h4>Density</h4>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>

				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

						<figcaption>Mid fall with density = 50 g/cm^2</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="Images/Part 2/dens-50-end.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Rest state with density = 50 g/cm^2</figcaption>
					</td>
					</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>Density plays a role in calculating the masspoints' acceleration.
			This is because According to Newton's laws, mass is given by 
			<em>m = &rho; &middot; V</em> and acceleration by <em>F = m/a</em>,
			where &rho; is equal to density. This means that the greater the density,
			the greater the force, because acceleration is constant.
		</p>
		<p>This can be observed in the images above. When density = 1 g/cm^2, the cloth is basically
			smooth with no wrinkles when it is falling and at its rest state. The top of the cloth
			is almost horizontal. As density
			increases, and thus force, more wrinkles and folds are created. The top of the cloth
			resembles more of a parabola now. At density = 15 g/cm^2,
			the cloth has mild folds at both the mid fall and rest state. When density = 50 g/cm^2,
			the cloth has the most pronounced folds and the greatest curvature at the top
			middle of the cloth.
		</p>

		</div>
		<p>Damping is the process where energy is lost in the environment.
			If damping, or d=0%, this means that no energy is lost. If d is greater
			than 0, this means that energy is lost. The rate energy is lost
			increases as d increases.
		</p>
		<p>This loss of energy can be observed with the various runs of the pinned
			cloth. When d is equal to 0%, the mass points, dont lose energy, which is why
			as it is falling, there is much more vibrations and wrinkles,
			indicating more energy. It also falls very fast, almost instantly, and continues to 
			oscillate, never coming to rest. As d goes up, the amoount of wrinkles decreases. When
			d = 0.2%, the cloth has fewer sharp wrinkles compared to when d = 0%, and the final rest
			state has softer folds. The extreme is when d = 1%. As it is falling, it appears to
			 be almost completely smooth and when it is at rest, it lacks the subtle folds
			 that d = 0.2% had. It falls much slower and comes to rest without any extra swinging.

		<p>As mentioned previously, ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. So the higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.</p>
			<p>With a low ks, ks = 500 N/m, the cloth is at its most elastic. The final
				resting state reflects this by having all of the cloth droop down almost 
				vertically. There are also many vertical folds. When ks = 5000 N/m, the 
				cloth becomes more stiff and there are less vertical folds now. The folds
				also beome less vertical, and start spreading out to the sides more. Finally,
				when ks = 50000 N/m, there are only a few vertical folds now. The folds are much
				bigger, and spread out even more to the sides, resisting gravity.

		<h3>Varying density and ks</h3>

		</div>
		<p>Once again, ks represents the spring constant and represents how stiff
			as spring is. So the higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring is.
			What this means for the cloth is that, the higher the ks, the stiffer
			the cloth.</p>
		<p>What this means is that, as ks increases, the more resistant to folds the 
			cloth becomes. When ks = 2500 N/m, The cloth folds against itself easily and 
			has the most folds. When ks = 5000 N/m, the cloth becomes slightly stiffer and 
			the folds become less chaotic. The folds are more 
			straight as compared to ks = 2500 N/m where the folds were kind of wavy. When ks
			= 50000 N/m, the cloth is very stiff. The folds are even straighter now and there
			are only a couple of big folds.

		<h4>Density</h4>

	<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
		<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">

			<figcaption>Mid fall with density = 30 g/cm^2</figcaption>
	</div>
	<p>As mentioned previously, density plays a role in calculating the masspoints' acceleration.
		This is because According to Newton's laws, mass is given by 
		<em>m = &rho; &middot; V</em> and acceleration by <em>F = m/a</em>,
		where &rho; is equal to density. This means that the greater the density,
		the greater the force, because acceleration is constant.
	</p>
	<p>Density's impact on the cloth's self collisions is the opposite of the spring constant's impact.
		As density increases, there are more folds and wrinkles in the cloth. The cloth is calmest when
		density is set at 1 g/cm^2. The folds are few and large, and there are barely any
		wrinkles. When density = 15 g/cm^2, the folds become more and smaller, with wrinkles
		starting to appear. When density is equal to 30 g/cm^2, it has the most folds. The folds
		are no longer smooth and relatively horizontal. They also have wrinkles in them.
	</p>
		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h4>What are vertex and fragment shaders</h4>
		Vertex shaders, as the name suggests, are used to control the vertices of a model. This is very useful for simulating physics and how a model interacts with the physical environment and itself. A fragment shader, on the other hand, controls how the model is rendered. This allows us to control how a model looks (e.g. specular illumination, ambient lighting, etc.). By combining both vertex and fragment shading, we are able to fully control how a model looks. We can use vertex shading to control the physical geometry of the model and then enhance it with lighting effects from the fragment shader.
		<br>
		<h4>Blinn-Phong Shading</h4>
		Blinn-Phong shading is a shading method to provide specular reflection and ambient lighting to a model. The shading formula is as follows:
		\[\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_a+\mathbf{L}_d+\mathbf{L}_s\]
		where
		\[\mathbf{L}_a = k_a\mathbf{I}_a\]
		\[\mathbf{L}_d=k_d\frac{\mathbf{I}}{r^2}\max(0, \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{l})\]
		\[\mathbf{L}_s=k_s\frac{\mathbf{I}}{r^2}\max(0, \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{h})^p\]
		Given this formula, you can see that Blinn-Phong shading is just the superposition of diffuse shading with an ambient lighting term and a specular lighting term. You can see this effect in the images below:
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Images/phong_ambient.png" width="400px"/>

				  <img src="Images/phong_total.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Full Blinn-Phong</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br>
		<h4>Texture, Bump and Displacement Mapping</h4>
		Once we have Blinn-Phong shading, we can build off this shader to implement texture mapping to add our own custom textures and even simulate coarseness with bump and displacement mapping. For texture mapping, we can get the map each pixel of the texture image to the pixels being rendered by the program using the <code>texture</code> function. You can see an example of texture mapping below:
		<br>
		<figure>
			<img src="Images/texture-2.png" alt="Cloth draped over sphere" style="width: 70%"/>
			<figcaption>Texture shader</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<br>
		With this new texture mapping, we can use the map to add bumps and defects to our models using bump and displacement shading. Bump and displacement shading produce the same effects, but displacement actually edits the physical mesh while bump does not. Thus, when rendering, the texture appears more defined with displacement over bump shading. In both shaders, the textures appear more defined when passing in <code>-a 128 -0 128</code> for coarseness, but you can see that displacement is slightly more defined.
		<br>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Images/sphere_bump_16.png" width="400px"/>

				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br>
		<h4>Mirror Shading</h4>
		Another type of shader we built is the mirror shader. The mirror shader essentially takes incoming light from a map of the environment (light that is essentiall infintely far away), and computes the outgoing reflected light ray. This is the result:
		<figure>
			<img src="Images/mirror.png" alt="Cloth draped over sphere" style="width: 70%"/>
			<figcaption>Mirror shader</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<h4>Extra Credit: Custom Shader</h4>
		For our custom shader, we decided to implement a time aspect to it. We added a time counter to  the <code>clothSimulaotr</code> class and passed it to <code>Custom.frag</code> as a uniform. With this new unifrom, we can now vary the shader with time. To create a glowing effect, we used took the regular bump shader effect and superimposed a separate glowing diffuse effect on the edges to create the cool glowing effect. We controlled the glow diffuse value by multiplying it by a \(\sin(ft)\) term so that we got a smooth fading effect. We can see the end result in the gif below:
