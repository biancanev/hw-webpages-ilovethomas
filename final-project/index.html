		<h2>Summary</h2>
		In this project, we will create a non photo-realistic renderer that can produce 3-5 different shading styles. These effects include cel shading (shading that makes the image look like a 2d drawing) watercolor shading (shading that makes it look like a watercolor painting) and sketch shading (shading that makes it look like a pencil/pen sketch). If there is time, we will implement…

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		In the field of computer graphics, engineers have always strived to create software and explore methods to create realistic 3D renderings. Although it is fascinating to see realistic models of the world as we see it on our screens, this process can be quite computationally expensive and sometimes even hyperrealistic. We, on the other hand, would like to explore ways to generate stylish and expressive visuals that are non-photorealistic using techniques such as cel shading, watercolor shading, and sketch shading. Cel shading requires algorithms that can produce distinct flat color areas resembling 2D drawings, watercolor shading demands blending that replicates fluid, and sketch shading involves hatching and different pencil strokes to mimic hand-drawn sketches. The main challenge for this project is the strike of balance between the creation of optimized shaders that produce authentic results and the efficiency of the algorithms implemented. We will measure the rendering efficiency along with visual accuracy across various images.
		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		The goal of this project is to implement three different forms of shading. These are cel shading, watercolor shading and sketch shading. With each different shader, we will render images that show off the different shaders. We aim to answer the question “How can we implement cel shading, watercolor shading and sketch shading for non-photo realistic rendering”. We will measure the quality of our system by measuring the rendering time of each image and rendering a minimum 3 different images per shader.

		Cel shading, short for celluloid shading, is a technique that gives 3d models the appearance of a 2d drawing. Instead of rendering with gradients and complex lighting, cel shading uses a simplified model of lighting with just a few flat areas of color. This could be one color for the lit area, one color for the shadow and one color for the highlight. Below are some examples of cel shading.

		Watercolor shading is a non photo-realistic rendering technique that aims at mimicking the soft, fluid look of traditional watercolor paintings. This involves gentle color blending, textured brush strokes, and semi-transparent layers. It can also appear uneven or washed out in places to make it look more handmade. This can be achieved through texture overlays (like grain or color bleeding), noise-based transparency of color, and edge darkening that simulates the pooling of paint. Below are examples of watercolor shading.

		</div>
		<br><br>
		Sketch shading is a non photo-realistic rendering technique that aims at mimicking the look of hand drawn pencil/pen sketches. This involves hatching, cross-hatching, and rough strokes to create depth and texture, achieved by using procedural line textures, stroke-based shaders, or techniques that detect edges and apply sketch-like marks. Below are some examples of sketch shading.

		<h2>What We Hope to Deliver</h2>
		If things go well and we are on top of our schedule, we would like to implement one to two more shaders. We also aim to have functional Shading Enhancements, including Cel, where we improve edge detection and lighting transitions for a cleaner, more dynamic 2D drawing effect, Watercolor, where we refined texture overlays, pigment bleeding, and color blending to more accurately mimic the fluidity and details of watercolor paintings, and Sketch, where we include a broader range of hatching techniques and stroke variations to produce richer hand-drawn pencil/pen appearances.
